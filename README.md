# PRES3

This is the development version of PRES3. It allows to work with all the services in the local machine 
and make easy updates and changes.

In order to make a realistic scenario we have created 3 repositories: 


# This the setup for the spark cluster in each VM
1) https://github.com/kostasrazgkelis/PRES3-Spark

# The web app repository for Bob/Alice
2# https://github.com/kostasrazgkelis/PRES-3-Alice

# The web app repository for Carol
